# kiran0718-Bone_Fracture_detection_3d_model_reconstruction
In the field of medical diagnostics, the accurate and timely detection of bone fractures is crucial for effective patient treatment and recovery. Traditional methods of fracture detection heavily rely on manual interpretation of medical imaging, which can be time-consuming and may lead to subjective interpretations. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development of an automated system that can efficiently detect bone fractures and analyze their severity based on medical imaging data.
